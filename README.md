### [Command line help and documentation](src/scripts/README.md)

### Notes

Sometimes there are troubles with **5Ghz bands** due to some vendor restrictions. If you cannot start hotspot while you are connected to 5Ghz band, Unselect **Auto** and select **2.4Ghz** in frequency selection.

If any problems with **RealTeK Wifi Adapters** see [this](docs/howto/realtek.md)

## Installation

**Note: If you have installed the previous version of this project make sure to uninstall it by checking out the previous version (v2.1.1 or below).
Also you can use `sudo make clean-old` without checking out the previous version. After that install the binaries. Otherwise your system might leave orphaned binaries and files.**

    git clone https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot
    cd linux-wifi-hotspot

    #build binaries
    make

    #install
    sudo make install
    
## Uninstallation
    sudo make uninstall
    
## Running
You can launch the GUI by searching for "Wifi Hotspot" in the Application Menu
or using the terminal with:

    wihotspot

## Run on Startup
The `wihotspot` GUI uses `create_ap` to create and manage access points. This service and core logic was originally created by
[@oblique](http://github.com/oblique), and are now maintained in this
repository.

Start the hotspot service on startup (using your saved configuration) with:

    systemctl enable create-ap

### Tested with Ubuntu from 16.04 to 20.04. If any issue is found, file an issue on github.
